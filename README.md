### Assignment One Instructions:


1. Make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.  Put the following text on your page:

- Guess what letter I'm thinking of

- Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

- Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

- Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

- Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

- When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

- When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
